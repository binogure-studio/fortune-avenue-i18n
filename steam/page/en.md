Welcome to Fortune Avenue, a strategic multiplayer board game. With the assurance of Steam VAC, we prioritize fair and secure multiplayer interactions. Unlike other games, Fortune Avenue steers clear of the pay-to-win model, ensuring that success is earned through skill and strategy rather than deep pockets.

Our dice mechanics are rooted in real-world physics, providing an authentic gaming experience. Every roll is a blend of chance and strategy, adding depth to your decisions. Adding another layer of excitement is our Wheel of Fortune, also governed by physics, to keep every game fresh and dynamic.
